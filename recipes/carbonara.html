 <p><h2>A quick and easy creamy italian pasta dish, made with absolutely no cream!</h2></p>
 <p> <h2> Ingredients</h2></p>
 <ul>
    <li>500g spaghetti</li>
    <li>2 tbsps olive oil</li>
    <li> 8 slices of smoked bacon</li>
    <li> 1 onion, chopped</li>
    <li> 1 clove of fresh garlic</li>
    <li>1/4 cup dry white wine</li>
    <li> 4 large eggs, beaten</li>
    <li> 1/2 cup of grated parmesan</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li> 2 tbsps chopped fresh parsley</li>
    <li> 2 tbsps grated parmesan</li>
 </ul> 
 <p> <h2> Method</h2></p>  
 <ol>
    <li> Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil. Cook spaghetti in boling water until cooked (al dente is recommended). Drain the spaghetti and mix with 1 tbsp of olive oil. Set aside for now. ( Hint- keep some of the pasta water incase you need to add more liquid to the dish before serving) </li>
    <li> Pan fry the diced bacon over a medium heat ( approx 10 minutes). Drain any excess fat, saving some in the pan for later.</li>
    <li> Add 1 tbsp olive oil to remaining bacon fat. Add chopped onion and cook on medium heat until the onion is translucent. Add the pressed garlic close and cook for about 1 minute. Add white wine and cook 1 minute more.</li>
    <li>Return cooked bacon to the pan; add cooked spaghetti. Toss to coat and heat through, adding more olive oil if it seems dry or sticks together. Add beaten eggs and cook, tossing constantly with tongs or a large fork, until eggs are barely set. Quickly add 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and toss again. Season with salt and pepper (remember that bacon and Parmesan are very salty). </li>
    <li>Serve warm with chopped parsley sprinkled on top and extra Parmesan cheese at the table.</li>
     </ol>
