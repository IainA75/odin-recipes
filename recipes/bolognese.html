    <h2> A classic Italian comfort food. Quick to make, and easy to scale up to feed the whole family. A delicious tomato based dish with ground beef and mixed vegetables and herbs. </h2>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul><li> 500g of spaghetti</li>
    <li> 2 tbsps olive oil</li>
    <li> 3 slices bacon, diced</li>
    <li> 1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li> 1 stalk celery, finely chopped</li>
    <li> 1 carrot, finely chopped</li>
    <li> 1 tsp dried oregano</li>
    <li> 3 cloves fresh garlic, pressed</li>
    <li> 500g beef mince</li>
    <li> 2 tbsps balsamic vinegar</li>
    <li> 2 400g tins chopped tomatoes</li>
    <li> 2 tbsps tomato puree</li>
    <li> 2 tsps white sugar</li>
    <li> salt and pepper to season to taste</li>
    <li> 2 tbsps chopped fresh basil</li>
    <li> cheese of choice to top</li>
    </ul>

<h1> Method</h1>
<ol> <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook the spaghetti in the boiling water until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain. </li>
    <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook the bacon in the oil until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir the onion, celery, carrot, and oregano into the bacon; continue cooking until the vegetables begin to soften, another 8 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Crumble the mince into the vegetable mixture; cook and stir until the beef is completely cooked and no longer pink, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Pour the balsamic vinegar over the ground beef mixture; allow to simmer until the liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. Stir the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and sugar into the mixture; bring the mixture to a boil, season with salt and black pepper, and remove from heat. Stir the fresh basil into the mixture. </li>
    <li>Ladle the sauce over the cooked spaghetti. Top with Parmesan cheese to serve. </li>
